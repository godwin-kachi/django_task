#Lessons from this class:

pipenv works fine in Windows 10 but you need to configure it way differently especially at installation stage. If you have a knowledge of file system in windows, it may be easy for you to play around it, but if you do not, then it may take around 10-15mins of sweat.

Also, I discovered that I had to bunk VSCode and migrate to pycharm, it makes writing python code easier but I am still learning the IDE
There is a clear difference between the way venv and pipenv works, I also hopes that I will eventually fall in love with pipenv.
